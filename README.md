## Digital Design with SystemVerilog

A central processing unit (CPU) shown below was designed and simulated in this digital design lab. Code was written in SystemVerilog, simulated using Icarus Verilog and the simulation waveforms plotted using GTKWave. 

The implemented components were: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the register file, the program memory, the program counter and the control unit. Components were combine in a hierarchical design to implement the microprocessor and programmed with simple machine code. All were thoroughly tested at each combination step.
